### Question 1:

**Tell me about a time when you were faced with a problem that had a number of possible solutions.
What was the problem and how did you determine the course of action?
What was the outcome?**

#### Your Answer:

**situation**:
In my previous role as a software engineer, we were using airtable service to manage our projects data and
we got an email that the service would be no longer save our static files after a month.
We had to find a new solution quickly to avoid losing important data and ensure continuity in our projects.

**task**:
I was responsible for finding a new solution that would meet our needs and ensure a smooth transition.

**action**:
I organized a brainstorming session where each team member could present their solution.
and at the end to narrow down the options, we created a pros and cons list for each solution.
there were 2 options:

- migrate all data from airtable to our own database and build a new interface for it.
- migrate only the static files to a new service and keep using airtable for the rest of the data.
-

The first option was more robust and would give us more control over our data, but it would take longer to implement.
The second option was quicker and easier to implement, but it would leave us dependent on a third-party service for our
static files.
After discussing the pros and cons, we decided to go with the second option.

**result**:
We migrated the static files s3 bucket to a new service and kept using airtable for the rest of the data.
The transition was smooth, and we were able to continue using airtable without any interruptions.

**When did you take a risk, make a mistake, or fail? How did you respond, and how did you grow?**

#### Your Answer:

**situation**:
In my previous role as a software engineer, I was working on a project that required us to use a new technology that I
was not familiar with.
I was excited to learn and took the lead on the project, but I underestimated the complexity of the technology and the
time it would take to learn it.

**task**:
I was responsible for leading the project and ensuring that we met our deadlines.

**action**:
I spent a lot of time trying to learn the new technology on my own, but I was struggling to keep up with the project
timeline.
I realized that I needed help, so I reached out to a colleague who had experience with the technology and asked for
their assistance.
They were happy to help, and we worked together to get the project back on track.

**result**:
We were able to complete the project on time, and I learned a valuable lesson about the importance of asking for help
when needed.
I also learned that it's okay to take risks and try new things, but it's important to be realistic about your abilities
and seek help when needed.

there were 2 options:

- build the new feature mobile app from scratch using react native.
- use webview to load the existing web app in the mobile app.

and due to the time constraint, we decided to go with the second option.

### Question 4:

**What did you do when you needed to motivate a group of people or promote collaboration on a project?**

#### Your Answer:

**situation**:
In my previous role as a software engineer, The task was refactor a legacy codebase and it was complex, involved dealing
with outdated systems, and progress
felt slow at times.

**task**:
As a senior engineer, I felt it was my responsibility to help re-energize the team and maintain momentum

**action**:
First, I scheduled a team meeting to openly discuss the challenges and acknowledge the difficulty of the task. I then
broke down the larger refactoring goals into smaller, more manageable and visible milestones. We started having short
daily stand-ups focused on celebrating small wins and addressing blockers immediately. I also took the initiative to
pair program with junior engineers on some of the more daunting modules, offering guidance and support. Furthermore, I
consistently highlighted the long-term benefits of this refactor – improved performance, maintainability, and reduced
technical debt – to remind everyone of the value of their work.

**result**:

The team became more engaged and motivated as we started to see tangible progress. The smaller milestones created a
sense of accomplishment, and the daily stand-ups fostered a culture of collaboration and support. By the end of the  
refactoring project, not only did we successfully modernize the codebase, but we also strengthened our team dynamics.
