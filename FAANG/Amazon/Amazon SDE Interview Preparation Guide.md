## Technical Topics - Coding and System Design

### Coding Questions (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 1. Data Structures and Algorithms
**Question (Priority: HIGH)**: "Design a system to detect network outages by analyzing patterns in network traffic data."

**Answer Framework**:
```python
class NetworkMonitor:
    def __init__(self, threshold=0.8, window_size=5):
        self.threshold = threshold
        self.window_size = window_size
        self.traffic_history = []
        self.alert_status = False
        
    def add_traffic_data(self, data_point):
        """Add a new traffic data point and maintain window size"""
        self.traffic_history.append(data_point)
        if len(self.traffic_history) > self.window_size:
            self.traffic_history.pop(0)
        
        # Check for potential outage after adding new data
        self._check_for_outage()
        
    def _check_for_outage(self):
        """Analyze traffic pattern for potential outages"""
        if len(self.traffic_history) < self.window_size:
            return False
            
        # Calculate average traffic
        avg_traffic = sum(self.traffic_history) / len(self.traffic_history)
        
        # Calculate standard deviation
        variance = sum((x - avg_traffic) ** 2 for x in self.traffic_history) / len(self.traffic_history)
        std_dev = variance ** 0.5
        
        # Check for sudden drop in traffic (potential outage)
        latest_traffic = self.traffic_history[-1]
        if latest_traffic < avg_traffic - (std_dev * self.threshold):
            self.alert_status = True
            return True
        
        self.alert_status = False
        return False
        
    def get_alert_status(self):
        return self.alert_status
```

**Explanation**:
- This solution implements a sliding window approach to monitor network traffic
- It calculates statistical measures (average and standard deviation) to detect anomalies
- The threshold parameter allows for tuning sensitivity to traffic variations
- Time complexity is O(1) for adding new data points and O(n) for checking outages, where n is the window size
- Space complexity is O(n) where n is the window size

        return self.status
        
    def get_metrics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "cpu_utilization": 45.2,
            "memory_utilization": 62.8,
            "active_connections": 1250,
            "packet_loss": 0.02
        }
        
class Switch(Device):
    def __init__(self, id: str, ip_address: str, location: str, ports: int):
        super().__init__(id, ip_address, location)
        self.ports = ports

            "memory_utilization": 45.2,
            "port_utilization": 0.75,
            "packet_errors": 0.001
        }

class MonitoringProtocol(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def connect(self, device: Device) -> bool:
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def collect_data(self, device: Device) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        pass

class SNMPProtocol(MonitoringProtocol):
    def connect(self, device: Device) -> bool:
        # SNMP connection implementation
        return True
        
    def collect_data(self, device: Device) -> Dict[str, Any]:

            if protocol.connect(device):
                results[device.id] = protocol.collect_data(device)
                
        return results
```

**Explanation**:
- This design uses the Strategy pattern for different monitoring protocols
- Abstract base classes define interfaces for devices and protocols
- Concrete implementations handle specific device types and protocols
- The NetworkMonitor class orchestrates the monitoring process
- This design allows for easy extension to support new device types or protocols

### Database Questions (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### 1. Database Design
**Question (Priority: MEDIUM)**: "How would you design a database schema for storing network performance metrics?"

**Answer Framework**:
```sql
-- Devices table to store information about network devices
CREATE TABLE devices (
    device_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    hostname VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    ip_address VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
    device_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(100),
    region VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Metrics table to store different types of metrics we can collect
CREATE TABLE metric_definitions (
    metric_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    metric_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    unit VARCHAR(20),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

-- Time-series data for device metrics
CREATE TABLE device_metrics (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    device_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    metric_id INT NOT NULL,
    value DECIMAL(20, 6) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (device_id) REFERENCES devices(device_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (metric_id) REFERENCES metric_definitions(metric_id),
    INDEX idx_device_metric_time (device_id, metric_id, timestamp)
);

-- Alerts table to store information about detected issues
CREATE TABLE alerts (
    alert_id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    device_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    metric_id INT NOT NULL,
    alert_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    severity VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (device_id) REFERENCES devices(device_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (metric_id) REFERENCES metric_definitions(metric_id)
);

-- Network topology to represent connections between devices
CREATE TABLE device_connections (
    connection_id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    source_device_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    target_device_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    connection_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (source_device_id) REFERENCES devices(device_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (target_device_id) REFERENCES devices(device_id)
);
```

**Explanation**:
- This schema supports storing device information, metric definitions, and time-series data
- It includes tables for alerts and network topology
- Indexing is used to optimize time-series queries
- The design supports horizontal scaling through partitioning by time
- For very large deployments, a specialized time-series database might be preferable

#### 2. Query Optimization
**Question (Priority: MEDIUM)**: "How would you optimize a query that needs to analyze network traffic patterns over the last 24 hours across thousands of devices?"

**Answer Framework**:
1. **Original Query (Problematic)**:
```sql
SELECT d.hostname, d.location, 
       AVG(dm.value) as avg_traffic, 
       MAX(dm.value) as peak_traffic,
       MIN(dm.value) as min_traffic
FROM device_metrics dm
JOIN devices d ON dm.device_id = d.device_id
JOIN metric_definitions md ON dm.metric_id = md.metric_id
WHERE md.metric_name = 'network_traffic'
AND dm.timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL 24 HOUR
GROUP BY d.hostname, d.location
ORDER BY avg_traffic DESC;
```

2. **Optimization Strategies**:
   - **Indexing**: Ensure proper indexes on timestamp, device_id, and metric_id columns
   - **Partitioning**: Partition the metrics table by time ranges
   - **Materialized Views**: Pre-aggregate common metrics
   - **Query Rewrite**: Use specific time ranges and limit joins

3. **Optimized Query**:
```sql
-- Assuming we know the metric_id for 'network_traffic' is 5
-- And we have a partitioned table and proper indexes

SELECT d.hostname, d.location, 
       AVG(dm.value) as avg_traffic, 
       MAX(dm.value) as peak_traffic,
       MIN(dm.value) as min_traffic
FROM device_metrics_last_24h dm  -- Partitioned table or view
JOIN devices d ON dm.device_id = d.device_id
WHERE dm.metric_id = 5  -- Direct reference instead of join
GROUP BY d.hostname, d.location
ORDER BY avg_traffic DESC;
```

4. **Additional Optimizations**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Consider using a specialized time-series database like InfluxDB or TimescaleDB
   - For real-time analysis, maintain rolling aggregates in memory
   - Use approximate algorithms for very large datasets (e.g., HyperLogLog for cardinality)
