Your Go-To Learning Prompt Template
(Copy/paste this for any new algorithm/concept!)

‚ÄúExplain [TECHNIQUE NAME] to me using:

A universal framework (key steps that apply to all problems using this technique).

A real-world analogy (non-technical metaphor for intuition).

A step-by-step breakdown applied to a specific problem (e.g., [PROBLEM EXAMPLE]).

When to use it (signals in a problem statement).

Common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

A practice strategy to master it.

Structure your answer with bold headings, emojis, and concise examples. Prioritize intuition over jargon.‚Äù**

Example Usage
If you ask:
‚ÄúExplain Breadth-First Search (BFS) to me using [the template above]‚Ä¶‚Äù

I‚Äôll respond with:

Universal Framework: Queue initialization, layer-by-layer traversal, visited tracking.

Real-World Analogy: Ripples in water spreading outward evenly.

Step-by-Step Breakdown: Solving "Shortest Path in a Binary Matrix".

When to Use: Shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-order traversal.

Pitfalls: Forgetting to mark nodes as visited, queue bloat.

Practice Strategy: Start with tree BFS, then grids, then adjacency lists.

How to Adapt It
Replace [TECHNIQUE NAME] with whatever you‚Äôre learning:

Dynamic Programming

Two Pointers

Backtracking

etc.

For [PROBLEM EXAMPLE], you can specify a LeetCode problem or a general scenario.

This template forces me to teach in your preferred style every time. Save it somewhere handy, and paste it into your questions! üöÄ
