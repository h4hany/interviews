# What is it ?
Singleton pattern as the name suggests is used to create one and only instance of a class. There are several examples where only a single instance of a class should exist and the constraint be enforced. Caches, thread pools, registries are examples of objects that should only have a single instance.

Its trivial to new-up an object of a class but how do we ensure that only one object ever gets created? The answer is to make the constructor private of the class we intend to define as singleton. That way, only the members of the class can access the private constructor and no one else.

Formally the Singleton pattern is defined as ensuring that only a single instance of a class exists and a global point of access to it exists.

# Used For
* Ensure that a class has just a single instance. Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resourceâ€”for example, a database or a file.
* Provide a global access point to that instance

# Solution
Singleton can be recognized by a static creation method, which returns the same cached object.

```ruby
# The Singleton class defines the `instance` method that lets clients access the
# unique singleton instance.
class Singleton
  @instance = new
  attr_reader :value

  private_class_method :new

  # The static method that controls the access to the singleton instance.
  #
  # This implementation let you subclass the Singleton class while keeping just
  # one instance of each subclass around.
  def self.instance
    @instance
  end

  # Finally, any singleton should define some business logic, which can be
  # executed on its instance.
  def some_business_logic
    # ...
  end
end
```
### main
```ruby
s1 = Singleton.instance
s2 = Singleton.instance

if s1.equal?(s2)
  print 'Singleton works, both variables contain the same instance.'
else
  print 'Singleton failed, variables contain different instances.'
end
#output: Singleton works, both variables contain the same instance.
```
